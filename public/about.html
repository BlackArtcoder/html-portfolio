<h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hello! I'm a dedicated data scientist currently working for Delta. I have a need and passion
     for building digital products and exploring data patterns with a human-centric approach. 
    My journey in tech deepened at Western Illinois University, where I developed a strong foundation
     in data and computer science, pursuing dual Master's Degrees in Applied Statistics and Decision Sciences,
      and Political Science and Public Policy.</p>

    <p>I'm also the founder of ClayMinds, a transformative learning experience.
       My vision for ClayMinds is to create a platform that fosters global connections </p>

  <p>Beyond my professional pursuits, I'm an avid reader, particularly interested in books about
     influential figures like Steve Jobs, David Packard, and the founder of Zoom.
      I believe that continuous learning and staying inspired by the achievements of others
       are crucial to personal and professional growth.</p>

<p>During my free time, I enjoy engaging in conversations about data science, technology, and
   public policy. I'm always open to new connections and collaborations,
    especially with individuals who share a passion for leveraging technology to make a
     positive impact.</p>

<p>Feel free to reach out to me if you share similar interests or if you're curious about ClayMinds.
   Let's connect and explore how we can learn and grow together!</p>
